# Imbue Quirks

## Issue
Need to tune duration relative to base-game behavior without replacing all imbue mechanics.

## Context
Directly overriding constants can ignore meaningful per-weapon/per-spell differences.

## Solution
Scale observed real-time drain per imbue, so baseline game behavior remains the reference and sliders act as multipliers.
